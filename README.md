# Cloning the repository using console commands
### If you are cloning from github

```bash

cd <Path to your folder>

git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/Pixelfield-ru/SungearEngine

cd SungearEngine

git checkout main (or the latest tag: tags/<latest-tag>)
```

### If you downloaded release archive with sources

```bash

cd <Path to Sungear Engine>

git submodule update --init --recursive 
```

# CMake
## Variables and Flags
- Flag `SG_BUILD_TESTS`: enables building of test targets.
- Flag `SG_BUILD_ENRY`: enables building the entry executable with editor plugin loading.

## Presets
- `debug-host`: debug build for host platform (no optimizations, includes debug info).
- `release-host`: release build for host platform (with optimizations, no debug info).

# How to build and run
### Building Sungear Engine Core
1) Bootstrap vcpkg.
2) Set SUNGEAR_SOURCES_ROOT system variable to the root of your Sungear Engine installation.
3) Restart your PC (required for the environment variable).
4) Open IDE, select a CMake preset and load the root `CMakeLists.txt`.
5) After loading select the desired CMake target.
6) Build the selected target.
7) On Windows: copy `<output-dir>/Sources/SGCore/SGCore.dll` to the same directory as the `.exe` file you're running  
(for example: `<output-dir>/Tests/Terrain/SGTerrainTest.exe`).

### Building Sungear Engine Editor
1) Make sure you are using the **same CMake preset** for both Sungear Engine Core and Editor.
2) Open Editor project in IDE (editor is in `Plugins/SungearEngineEditor`).
3) Load CMake Project.
4) After loading choose target to build.
5) Build chosen target.

### Running with Editor
1) Build the `SungearEngine CMake target.
2) Run executable file: `<output-dir>/Sources/SGEntry/SungearEngine`
